<h1>Hiking Holiday</h1>
This project for the 2nd milestone project is focused on searching for appropiate hikes in an area you are visiting or even around home.  

Preliminary research is essential to enjoying a holiday abroad or even a staycation and this site will assist users in their search for 
the most appropiate and best hike in the area where they live or are visiting.  

<h2>UX</h2>
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

The mockup for this project is available <link src="assets/mockups/MilestoneProject2Mockupbmpr.pdf">here.</link>

##Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

##Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
1.  Enchanced features will include extra search fields to provide the most accurate results.
2.  Utilizing the Roads API the full route of the hike will display on the map instead of just the starting point, which is what currently displays.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
**HTML** 
The basic structure and display page was created using HTML.
**CSS** 
Design and enhancement of user experience was done with CSS to make it an easy to read and navigate site. 
**JavaScript**
**Bootstrap**
Used for the form and the layout of the page. 
**Font Awesome** 
Used for the  icons in the search results to make them easier to read.
**JQuery**
Used to simplify DOM manipulation and some of the code.

<h2>Testing</h2>
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
<h3>Map Functionality</h3>
Opened page to confirm map appears

<h3>Search Functionality</h3>
1. Had map functionality working
2. Connected JavaScript File to HikingProject example API
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
